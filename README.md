The Dough Calculator is a simple web app designed for bread and pizza makers who want accurate ingredient measurements based on the exact dough they plan to make. Instead of guessing quantities, the app calculates the correct ratios of flour, water, salt, and yeast for both bread and pizza. Users can adjust the whole wheat percentage, number of loaves or pizzas, loaf size or pizza diameter, hydration level, and yeast type (sourdough starter, dry yeast, or baker’s yeast), while also seeing whether they have enough flour available. A built-in Notes section allows bakers to record hydration, rise time, oven temperature, results, and improvements, and a Recipes & Videos tab is included for people who don’t know where to start. The app runs extremely smoothly and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to use with no sign up or other gimmicks. Created by ChickChickRam, this tool is meant to make dough planning simpler, more precise, and more enjoyable for home bakers.
